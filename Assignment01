// Here are 9 variables declared (but not assigned) using a standard convention for Hungarian Notation prefixes:

    sFirstName: let sFirstName;
    sLastName: let sLastName;
    sAddress: let sAddress;
    sCity: let sCity;
    sState: let sState;
    nZipCode: let nZipCode;
    nYourAge: let nYourAge;
    sReferralSource: let sReferralSource;

let sFirstName = "Sreedhar";
let sLastName = "Narla";
let nYourAge = 56;

Here is an example that can run directly in your browser's developer console. 

let myVariable;

// Assign a number and a string
let myNumber = 100;
let myString = "50";

myVariable = myNumber + myString;
console.log(myVariable);


Example 1: Boolean + String

let myVariable1;
let myBoolean = true;
let myString = " is a fact.";

myVariable1 = myBoolean + myString;

console.log(myVariable1);

Expected output:

true is a fact.

Example 2: Number + Boolean

let myVariable2;
let myNumber = 50;
let myBoolean = true;

myVariable2 = myNumber + myBoolean;

console.log(myVariable2);

Expected output:

51
